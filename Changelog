=======

 * SockJS-client can only send UTF-8 encodable strings.  Previously we
   took advantage of rich data structures and automatically
   json-encoded them, but this got removed.  Now, all data passed to
   `send` will be converted to string. This is also how native
 * `status` property on `EventClose` is renamed to `code`
   as per Websocket API
   WebSockets behave.
 * The test server was updated to new `sockjs-node` API
 * Fixed problem with Jsonp-polling transport on IE9
 * Repository was moved - updated links.

0.0.4
=====

 * All transports were refactored, some transports were introduced:
   htmlfile and separate xhr-streaming.
 * Added logic to detect support for http chunking, and thus a
   possibility to rule out streaming transports before running them.
 * Added 'cookie' option, useful for cookie-based load balancing
   (currently, it make a difference only for IE).
 * Added hack to prevent EventSource from crashing Safari and Chrome.
 * Loads and loads of other small and medium changes.

0.0.2
=====

 * Initial support for JSESSIONID based load balancing. Currently
   doesn't play nicely with IE XDomainRequest transport.


0.0.1
=====

 * Initial release.
